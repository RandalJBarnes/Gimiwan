## Origin of the Project Name

The project name __Nagadan__ is the Ojibwe word for the inanimate transitive verb "leave it behind". See [http://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu](http://ojibwe.lib.umn.edu/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=nagadan&commit=Search&type=ojibwe). This name seems appropriate for a program used to identify potential outliers.
